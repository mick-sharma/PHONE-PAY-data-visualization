Project Title:
Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

Technologies:
Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,
mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.

Domain : Fintech

The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in a MySQL database.

Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.

Results:

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays
information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive
and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will have at least 10 different
dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The data
will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be
dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.

Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate
the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. The dashboard will
provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse
Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.

Overall, the result of this project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution
for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github
repository.
